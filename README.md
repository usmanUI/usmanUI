### My GitHub Stats:

(Yeah, these are the "charts and cool stuff"!)

These dynamic cards give a quick overview of your activity. You gotta generate them using a service like `github-readme-stats`. Here's how you'd typically include them:

![UsmanUI GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=usmanUI&show_icons=true&theme=dark&include_all_commits=true&count_private=true)

![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=usmanUI&layout=compact&theme=dark)

<!-- You can customize the theme, hide specific repos, etc. Check out the github-readme-stats repo for full options: https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats -->
